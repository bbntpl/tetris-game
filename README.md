# tetris-game
Date: 2021

This is my tetris game implementation using vanilla Javascript with a basic idea of how the tetris logic game works while following it through a tutorial video.

### Purpose of this mini-project
These are the main reasons for this simple game recreation project: to polish my refactoring skills, to simply recreate my childhood game, and identify my programming weaknesses to improved.

### Notes for myself
* Pay more attention to details - Imagine debugging a simple error that can be approximately fixed at less than 5 seconds and it takes you 20 minutes just to find that there is a missing evil parentheses from the const function which is supposedly a factory function. This occured to me several times, atleast averagely of 3 times per coding projects which leads to "while (condition) { const frustration = Infinite" };
* Practice entering flow state - I recently discovered that there are certain days where I'm in a state of godlike coding where I somehow code efficiently/productively and actually knows what I'm doing without losing any motivation to stop moving forward until the goal for the day has been achieved. 
* Understand the project before code implementation
* Code efficiently by:
    *   Prioritizing the aspects of the project
    *   Finish the essential aspects of the code before moving on to the other problems


### Tetris Rules:
These are the following rules that are new to me:
- Added shifting rule when close to the wall while rotating.
- The "7 bag".
- Tetris Glossary: The proper term is 'tetrominos' instead of tetrominoes.
- Floor kick and right/wall kick
